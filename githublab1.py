#Convert minutes to int
Minutes =  int(Minutes)

#find how many days from the inutes provided
day = Minutes/60/24

#find how many years from the days calculated
year = day/365

#find teh remaining days
remaining_day =  day % 365


print(f'{Minutes} minutes is approximately {year:.0f} year(s) and {remaining_day:.0f} days')
